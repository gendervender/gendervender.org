        <h6>Lead Developer</h6>
        <h4>Melissa Jones</h4>
        <p>
            I am a lifelong computer nerd and lover of technology. Technology has been a major part of my life since I was young.
            I first attempted programming when I was about 14. I am mostly self taught when it comes to Hardware and Software knowledge
            but have also had professional experience. I have worked at companies such as Microsoft, Boeing, Nintendo, and Apptio.
            Currently I am an intern at Atlas Networks as a Development Intern.
            For fun I like to hoop dance and play video games. My goal is to become a UI Developer.
            To me this means someone who can design and implement the design with code. I currently have experience with multiple programming languages and design tools
            which I plan to expand during my final year (2018-2019) of school.

        <h6>Creative Director</h6>
        <h4>Nicole Lee</h4>
        <p>
            Being a visual person, my interest in UI, UX, and graphic design comes from my passion in photography, videography, and fashion.
            My creative ability comes from a young age. After winning second place in an art show that my 3rd grade teacher entered the whole class in,
            I knew I wanted to do something that puts my creative abilities to use. I love the process of designing a project and seeing the difference between
            the initial design ideation to the final product. Seeing the reaction of clients always reminds me why I love designing.
            I currently work at the University of Washington Bothell as a Media, Marketing, Graphic Designer, where I am exploring different styles of design.

        <h6>UX/UI Designer</h6>
        <h4>Sergio Mejia</h4>

        <p>
            I am incredibly interested in technology and how it can be applied to solve problems, especially for communities that are often overlooked by the technology sector.
            My design approach revolves around inclusively, empathy and looking to combine these two values to create the best possible experience for the user.
            I pull inspiration from experiences in low income and minority communities and strive to design for a diverse audience. I find joy in the ability to explore ideas with
            a central aim to help people solve problems that help improve an aspect of their everyday lives.

        <h6>Project/Product Manager</h6>
        <h4>Leah Shin</h4>
        <p>
            I tell brand stories through creative marketing, design (UI/UX), and project management. Fascinated by people and technology, and human-centered in everything I do.
            Currently, I am senior majoring in Interactive Media Design and Business.
            My work experience has been at T-Mobile, Microsoft, and Jumpstart in roles such as Product Management, Technology Solutions Management, Marketing & Operations Communications Management,
            Creative Marketing & Design, Technology Product Management, and Cybersecurity.

        <h6>Front-end Developer</h6>
        <h4>Tammy Tran</h4>
        <p>
            I always knew I loved design and technology ever since I was little. Growing up, I enjoyed coming up with home and room designs and I would play video games all the time.
            As I grew older, I thought business would be my passion but after takings a web development class, I realized I really enjoyed designing and coding.
            After finding out that there was a major for design and developing, I took the opportunity to apply to Interactive Media Design and thankfully, I got in.
            Being in this major, I realized that I enjoy solving problems and coming up with ways to bring awareness to people through design and technology.
            I currently work at the University of Washington Bothell IT Helpdesk where I get to work with different types of technology and expand my knowledge and
            after I graduate, I hope to expand my knowledge in design too.
